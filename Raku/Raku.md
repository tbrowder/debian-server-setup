To install Raku, I use the 'rakudo-pkg' third party Debian package
installed by follow the instructions found at
(Rakudo.org)[https://rakudo.org].

I pay attention to the following points to ensure a successful
installation:

+ Before executing the default curl script, I become the 'root'
  use by executing:
    $ sudo su
    #

+ Use the 'copy' button to copy the default curl script and execute
  it in terminal window you used in the previous step.
